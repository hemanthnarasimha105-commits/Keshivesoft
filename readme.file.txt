Bootstrap 5 Multi-Page Website — Keshive Soft

This project is a simple and responsive multi-page website built using Bootstrap 5.
It includes three pages — Home, About, and Contact — each designed with clean layouts, smooth responsiveness, and reusable components.
The site uses Bootstrap CDN, so there’s no need to install or configure anything locally.

📁 Project Files

✨ What’s Inside

Bootstrap 5 Navbar that stays consistent across all pages

Hero Carousel with beautiful full-width images and captions

Feature Sections built with Bootstrap cards and grids

Responsive Contact Form with basic JavaScript validation and success alert

Footer that keeps the design balanced on every page

Everything is responsive and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

🧠 How It Works

All Bootstrap styles and scripts are loaded through the official CDN links.

The carousel uses real image URLs from Unsplash — you can easily replace them with your own.

The contact form doesn’t send data to a server but shows a success message when you click Send Message (handled with a small JavaScript snippet).

🧩 Customization

You can change the text, links, and images directly inside the HTML files.

For color and spacing tweaks, use Bootstrap utility classes like p-4, bg-light, text-center, etc.

To add your own style, create a new CSS file (like style.css) and link it in the <head> section.
